Jump King Quest Interactive Map

This is an interactive map for Jump King Quest, created as a fan project. The map allows users to explore different locations within the game and view various marked points of interest. It features easy navigation and provides visual markers for key areas on the map, with the ability to zoom in and out.
Features

    Interactive map: Users can zoom in/out and explore the entire map.
    Marked locations: Key areas in the game (such as shrines, areas, and points of interest) are marked for easy reference.
    Responsive design: The map is optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
    Fan project: This is a fan-made project based on the Jump King Quest game. I do not own any of the assets used in the map.
